        <h3>Designs for Moderator Interface for regulationroom.com</h3><br>
        <p class="para">Over the summer of 2014, I worked for Professor Gilly Leshed of Cornell University in the Social Interaction Lab.
          I worked on the moderator interface for a website called regulationroom.com, which is a website where government
          agencies can post new rulings to the public and the public can comment and make suggestions. Each comment needs to
          be read by trained moderators, however, they were having problems reading, sorting and responding to more than 10
          comments in an hour. When a new ruling was posted there would often be about 300 comments in an hour. I was hired
          to design an interface that gave the moderators the ability to do their job more effectively and efficiently. <br><br>

          To design this interface I used an iterative research process. Last year, another student interviewed the moderators
          for an interface that was never implemented but gathered data on how each moderator completes the given task during the day.
          It was my job to read and understand the process of each moderator and then build a new interface to suit all their needs and methods.
          Overall I designed probably 20 interfaces in about 5 cycles, which each cycle presenting them to either my Professor or other members
          of the Regulation Room team. I used paper prototypes to test early designs.
          For the final presentation was done in Balsamiq and featured an interactive medium fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h1>Early Concepts</h1>
        <p>The early part of this project was understanding what parts of the moderator
          interface were causing the problems in efficiency.  After careful research into
           the interviews with the moderators and discussion with the moderators' manager,
           I determined that the problems arose from the inability to view the agencies' proposal
            at the same time as the users' comments, the inability to
           quickly navigate from one subtopic to another, and finally viewing their "To Do" list of comments that their manager gives them.<br><br>
         Many of the early designs focused on changing the smaller part of the moderator interface, rather than redesign the whole interface.</p>

        <p>One of the earliest versions of the designs, here I wanted to address the problem that the
          moderators had with viewing both the comments and the proposal at the same time.
          Most of the moderators had to keep open multiple tabs in order to feel they were successfully responding
          to the comment in the scope of the proposal.
          Here I addressed this issue by having a scrolling sidebar that contained all the comments on the moderator's To-Do list. </p><br>
        <img src="../img/Cornell_Research/screen2.jpg" alt="Seamstess Concept 1">
        <p>This early version of the moderator interface design features a top navigation bar where moderators can
          navigate easily from sub-topic of discussion to another.  While the user can only view one comment at a time,
          this interface tries to address the problem that the moderators were having with viewing and navigating between each subtopic.</p>
