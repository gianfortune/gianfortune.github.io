        <p>Over the summer of 2014, I worked for Professor Gilly Leshed of Cornell University in the Social Interaction Lab.
          I worked on the moderator interface for a website called regulationroom.com, which is a website where government
          agencies can post new rulings to the public and the public can comment and make suggestions. Each comment needs to
          be read by trained moderators, however, they were having problems reading, sorting and responding to more than 10
          comments in an hour. When a new ruling was posted there would often be about 300 comments in an hour. I was hired
          to design an interface that gave the moderators the ability to do their job more effectively and efficiently. <br>

          My Process: To design this interface I used an iterative research process. Last year, another student interviewed the moderators
          for an interface that was never implemented but gathered data on how each moderator completes the given task during the day.
          It was my job to read and understand the process of each moderator and then build a new interface to suit all their needs and methods.
          Overall I designed probably 20 interfaces in about 5 cycles, which each cycle presenting them to either my Professor or other members
          of the Regulation Room team. I used paper prototypes to test early designs.
          For the final presentation was done in Balsamiq and featured an interactive medium fidelity prototype.</p>
